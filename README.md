A collection of curated awesome lists for MLOps repositories and resources.
I Add my personal thoughts as "PT"

awesome-mlops:
there are cool repos on github talking about Mlops. Clearly it is not a reasonable thing if I redo al things that done before!
[awesome-mlops](https://github.com/kelvins/awesome-mlops) ---->> PT: very usefull repo
[Facets](https://github.com/PAIR-code/facets)

Just on of many usefull libraries for visualizing your dataset. 

PT:This is a good library but is not my first choice!
